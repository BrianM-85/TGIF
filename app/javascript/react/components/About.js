    <div id="about"> 
      <p>TGIF was a popular two hour television programming block that began in 1989 and ran until 2000. Each Friday night a block of four 30-minute episodes from different shows would air together.</p>

      <p>While many of the shows are available on Hulu.com and other streaming platforms at this point, there was not a resource online letting fans know which episodes aired together and on what specific nights.</p>

      <p>This website was created to make this information available again so that fans can rewatch a specific Friday night of TGIF programming and experience the shows together! </p>

      <p>There are currently <b>{getAboutData.shows}</b> shows and <b>{getAboutData.episodes}</b> episodes in the database. This represents yearly programming data up to the Spring 1995 but we hope to add additional years of show data in the near future!</p>
